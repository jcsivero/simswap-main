The Microsoft Data Access SDK is a one-stop shop for all the developer's needs to develop data access applications.  The Data Access SDK if focused to address specific developer activities.


---------------
2. NEW FEATURES
---------------
New combined documentation addresses all the Data Access technologies.

A new sample highlights Data Access technologies.

The Data Access SDK combines OLE DB, ODBC, OSP, and Control Writer Toolkit documentation.

------------------
3. TECHNICAL NOTES
------------------
Requirements:

The stand-alone SDK requires Internet Explorer 3.02.

For Windows 95: requires OSR2.

-----------------
4. KNOWN BUGS, LIMITATIONS, AND WORKAROUNDS
-----------------

The following is a list of Data Access SDK known bugs.

The localized Microsoft Data Access Components can be found on Disk 2 under \MDAC2.  They are not compiled as part of this SDK.

Installation issues: 

The Data Access SDK delivered with Visual Studio requires that the Microsoft Data Access components be installed prior to installing this SDK. Otherwise, when the SDK setup is run, you will get the message "Unable to load ODBC Control Panel (odbccp32.dll)". To resolve this, make sure that you have run the Visual Studio setup before installing the Data Access SDK.

With Internet Explorer 2.0, the stand-alone SDK fails to register Hhctrl.ocx. Internet Explorer 3.02 (and OSR2 on Windows 95) are required for successful installation of the Microsoft Data Access components.

-----------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 2: OLE DB PROVIDER FOR ODBC
-----------------------------------------------------------

OLE DB Provider for ODBC Data Sources Issues:

Please see the Data Access SDK documentation for a full list of known issues and limitations with the ODBC provider. This section documents only issues not included in that documentation.

IOpenRowset doesn't quote table names.  
The ODBC provider does not quote table names passed through DBIDs; for instance, in IOpenRowset. Therefore, when trying to open a table against the ODBC provider that requires quoting the name (for instance, when the table name contains extended characters), the consumer must add the quotes to the table name manually, or simply execute SELECT * FROM <quoted table name>.

Boolean parameters are not converted to "True"/"False".
The OLE DB version 1.5 Specification calls for Booleans converted to string data types to appear as the strings "True" or "False". Using the ODBC provider, if the underlying ODBC driver does not support SQLDescribeParam, and the OLE DB consumer does not specify the type of the parameter, the ODBC provider will convert Boolean parameter values to "-1" and "0" when the data type of the parameter is a string. In order to ensure proper conversion against ODBC drivers that do not support describing parameters, the OLE DB consumer should always call SetParameterInfo to specify the types of parameters. 

Do not use DBPROP_INIT_LOCATION with MSDASQL and a Microsoft Access database. 
When attempting to initialize MSDASQL (the ODBC Provider), if you set the initialization property DBPROP_INIT_LOCATION to a valid value and specify that the DATASOURCE is a Microsoft Access data source, a crash will occur. Do not use the property DBPROP_INIT_LOCATION with MSDASQL and a Microsoft Access data source.  

The following data types are in the OLE DB 2.0 headers but not yet supported by the conversion library, Msdadc.dll:

	DBTYPE_ARRAY	= 0x2000**,
	DBTYPE_VECTOR	= 0x1000**,
	DBTYPE_RESERVED	= 0x8000**,
	DBTYPE_UDT	= 132**,
	DBTYPE_HCHAPTER	= 136** 

-----------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 3: OLE DB CONFORMANCE TEST
-----------------------------------------------------------

OLE DB Conformance Test Issues:

Several ADO conformance tests have problems with read-only providers. Specifically, Requery, Editmode, and Originalvalue tests attempt to modify the recordset without checking for read-only.  

ADO conformance tests currently require the PROGID. The ADO conformance tests currently require a provider to put its PROGID in the default string entry for the provider's CLSID registry key.

Currently the SDK installs Win32 and Alpha versions of the libs for a Win32 install. In future releases, only the platform-appropriate libs will be installed.

ICommand is one of the "Unsupported" tests. The .dsp and .rc files for ICommand are not included in this build of the SDK.

----------------------
1. PRODUCT DESCRIPTION
----------------------

The Microsoft OLE DB Simple Provider (OSP) Toolkit simplifies the development of OLE DB providers for simple, tabular data (for example, text files or in-memory arrays). A developer can code to a simple interface, IOLEDBSimpleProvider, and the OSP mapping layer DLL, MSDAOSP.DLL, included with the Data Access core components provides a layer on top of this simpler interface that serves a Level-0-conformant provider to OLE DB consumers.

---------------
2. NEW FEATURES
---------------

The OLE DB Simple Provider Toolkit for this release includes:

An updated sample for Visual Basic, which uses new data binding features of Visual Basic 6.0.

Bug fixes to the OSP mapping layer (MSDAOSP.DLL) to achieve OLE DB level 0 conformance.

------------------
3. TECHNICAL NOTES
------------------

3.1 OSP INTERFACE IN MICROSOFT INTERNET EXPLORER 4.0

3.1.1 SIMPDATA.H

The OSP interface, described in SIMPDATA.H, was previously released with Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0.  The OSP interface released with the OLE DB Simple Provider Toolkit includes a modification of the OSPFIND enumeration. It adds enumeration value OSPFIND_UPCASESENSITIVE.  Providers written with this value will not compile using the previous version of SIMPDATA.H.


3.2 COM AND OLE DB CONFORMANCE

The OLE DB Simple Provider DLL functions as a Level 0 OLE DB Provider.  However, the following nuances have been noted during conformance testing:

3.2.1 IConnectionPoint::Advise

IConnectionPoint::Advise() returns the same cookie for different connections, since it returns the sink pointer as the cookie. According to the OLE specification, Advise() should return a token that uniquely identifies this connection. Typically each sink has a different pointer and therefore a different cookie. If the listener uses the cookie returned by Advise() in a subsequent Unadvise(), it will not unadvise the correct connection. To avoid this problem, do not register the same sink for the same notification.

3.2.2 IOpenRowset::OpenRowset

If no data member is specified on OpenRowset -- because no registration settings have been entered, or because no data source initialization property has been set -- MSDAOSP.DLL returns error DB_E_NOTABLE, which indicates that the table does not exist in the current data source. 

3.2.3  Properties

3.2.3.1 DBPROP_ROWSET_ASYNCH

MSDAOSP.DLL supports property DBPROPVAL_ASYNCH_SEQUENTIALPOPULATION. The default value is (DBPROPVAL_ASYNCH_INITIALIZE | DBPROPVAL_ASYNCH_SEQUENTIALPOPULATION | DBPROPVAL_ASYNCH_RANDOMPOPULATION).

3.2.3.2 DBPROP_COLUMNRESTRICT

When an OSP contains a read-only rowset (that is, getRWStatus() returns OSP_READONLY for all rows and columns), MSDAOSP.DLL sets properties DBPROP_ROWRESTRICT and DBPROP_COLUMNRESTRICT to VARIANT_TRUE. This reflects the possibility that the OSP may still allow new rows to be added, and these new rows might be updatable. If a new, updatable row is added, then columns may have mixed write status.  

3.3 PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE NOTES

3.3.1 Visual J++

3.3.1.1 isAsync()

IOLEDBSimpleProvider::isAsync() returns type int in Java instead of Boolean because of how the interface definition is generated. Developers should return 0 for false and a nonzero integer for true.

3.3.1.2 getVariant()

getVariant is one of the few OSP methods that returns an Object or Variant. Take care to allocate a fresh Variant that is not used elsewhere to return to the Microsoft Virtual Machine for Java, which may free the object at its leisure.

3.3.1.3 OSP Methods for Visual J++ and Internet Explorer 4.0

The OSP class package for Java developers, com.ms.osp.*, was released in Internet Explorer 4.0 with alternative versions of three of the OSP methods:

find()
getVariant()
setVariant()

In package com.ms.osp.*, these three methods are defined with arguments of type Object, instead of the Variant forms of the methods defined in the OSP interace, as distributed in this SDK in the type library SIMPDATA.TLB.  Internet Explorer 4.0 contains native marshaling code, invoked by the com.ms.osp.* package, which converts the Object instances to Variants (using variant VT_UNKNOWN as a default).  The OSP to OLE DB mapping layer, MSDAOSP.DLL, released in this SDK does not include custom marshaling.  As a result, simple providers written in Java using the Internet Explorer com.ms.osp.* package will not work with the OSP DLL released in this SDK unless Internet Explorer 4.0 is installed to provide the custom marshaling.

3.3.1.4 CLASSPATH Settings

In order to run the OSP Java sample, ensure that the Java virtual machine can locate the sample's compiled class files by adding their location to the Java class path search order. You may use the environment variable CLASSPATH for this purpose.

3.3.2 Visual Basic

The sample simple provider found in project SampleOSP_VB.vbp has been updated to work with new data binding functions of Visual Basic version 6.0.  It no longer compiles with Visual Basic 5.0.  Refer to the Simple provider Toolkit Help for instructions on building a simple provider using Visual Basic 5.0

-----------------
4. KNOWN BUGS, LIMITATIONS, AND WORKAROUNDS
-----------------

The following is a list of OLE DB Simple Provider Toolkit 2.0 known bugs and limitations:

On CanConvert, MSDAOSP.DLL returns E_INVALIDARG instead of S_FALSE for new data types added to the OLE DB 2.0 specification.

IRowsetFind does not yet support new compare operators NOTBEGINSWITH and NOTCONTAINS, added to the OLE DB 2.0 specification.

MSDAOSP.DLL does not support DBPROP_PROVIDERFRIENDLYNAME.

On CanConvert with dwConvertFlags != DBCONVERTFLAGS_COLUMN, MSDAOSP.DLL returns S_FALSE instead of DB_E_BADCONVERTFLAG.

Asynchronous Population

Unless the underlying OSP is asynchronous, setting property DBPROP_ROWSET_ASYNCH will have no effect.  MSDAOSP.DLL will not return until the rowset is populated.

In its asynchronous polling loop, MSDAOSP.DLL does not check the transferComplete() event fired by the underlying OSP.

Property DBPROP_INIT_ASYNCH is supported as READWRITE, but initialization of the Data Source object is always synchronous and immediate.

Property DBPROP_ROWSET_ASYNCH is supported as READONLY, but population of the Rowset is determined by the underlying OSP via the isAsync() method.

MSDAOSP.DLL is using the Data Source property instead of the Rowset property to determine the consumer's preference for synchronous or asynchronous behavior.
