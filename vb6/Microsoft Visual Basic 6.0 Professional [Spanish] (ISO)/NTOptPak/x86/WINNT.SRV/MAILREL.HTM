<ul>
<li>Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0</li>
<li>A partition large enough to hold the SMTP queue
<li>Microsoft Windows&nbsp;NT Service Pack 3 (or later), which is available from the \Support\Qfe directory on the installation compact disc or from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/ntserversupport/" target="_top">http://www.microsoft.com/ntserversupport/</a></li>
<li>Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) version 4.0</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2><a name="Installation">Installing Microsoft SMTP Service</a></h2>

<p><strong><span style="color: #FF0000"><font color="#0000FF">IMPORTANT</font></span></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You cannot use Microsoft SMTP Service as an upgrade from previous versions of Microsoft Commmercial Internet System (MCIS) Mail Server. If you are upgrading to Microsoft SMTP Service, use the following procedure to remove previous versions of Microsoft MCIS Mail Server before running Setup.</p>

<p><STRONG>To remove MCIS Mail Server</STRONG></p>

<h2><a name="Relay">Restrictions on Relaying Mail <br>
Through Microsoft SMTP Service</a></h2>

<p>Because of the growing problem on the Internet concerning Unsolicited Commercial E-Mail (UCE), Microsoft SMTP Service, by default, does not allow mail to be relayed through it to an external e-mail address. Mail addressed to any domain not configured for the SMTP site is rejected with the error "550 Unable to relay for &lt;mail address&gt;." To allow mail to be relayed from specific IP addresses, change the settings in the <STRONG>Relay Restrictions</STRONG> section of the <STRONG>Directory Security</STRONG> property sheet.</p>

<p><STRONG>Note</STRONG> Changing the settings to allow unrestricted relay through your SMTP server on the Internet makes your site a prime target for UCE. UCE can consist of special offers, commentaries, or any message a sender wants to convey to as many recipients as possible across the Internet. Often, senders relay UCE through well-known, trusted servers on the Internet to make messages appear as though they originated from a trusted host, or to make it difficult to determine the origin of the messages.</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="Client">Client Software</a></h2>

<p>Microsoft SMTP Service included in the Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack is designed to be used as an outbound mailer for mail-enabled applications. It does not provide the POP3 or IMAP4 protocol support necessary for use by e-mail client software. Mailboxes are not available in Microsoft SMTP Service.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="Ssl">Secure Mail Transmission</a></h2>

<p>To protect communications, you can configure Microsoft SMTP Service to encrypt SMTP transmissions using Transport Layer Security (TLS). This protection is provided through the <KBD>STARTTLS</KBD> SMTP protocol command. The command is described in the Internet draft titled "SMTP Service Extension for Secure SMTP over TLS," and located at <a href="ftp://ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-hoffman-smtp-ssl-03.txt" target="_top">ftp://ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-hoffman-smtp-ssl-03.txt</a>. </p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="CDONTS">Installing the Collaboration Data Objects <br>
for Windows NT Server Header File</a></h2>

<p>Developers using the Collaboration Data Objects for Windows NT Server library, Cdonts.dll, may also need the header file. This header file is useful for C++ developers and contains class and dual interface definitions, class IDs, constants, and error codes. The Cdonts.h header file is available from the following location on the installation compact disc:</p>
<p>\ntoptpak\en\&lt;x86 | alpha&gt;\winnt.srv</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="Auth">Configuring Authentication for All Browsers</a></h2>

<p>If the browser you are using does not support Windows NT Challenge/Response for authentication, you can change the default Web site setting to transmit account and password information in clear text. To change the authentication setting, complete the following steps:</p>
<OL>
	<LI>Start Internet Service Manager and expand the directory hierarchy for the default web site.
	<LI>Select the <STRONG>Mail</STRONG> folder.
	<LI>Select <STRONG>Properties</STRONG> from the <STRONG>Action</STRONG> menu and then select the <STRONG>Directory Security</STRONG> property sheet.
	<LI>Under <STRONG>Anonymous Access and Authentication Control</STRONG>, choose <STRONG>Edit</STRONG>.
	<LI>Select <STRONG>Basic Authentication</STRONG>.
	
</OL>

<hr>

<h2><a name="WebAdmin">Using Internet Service Manager (HTML)</a></h2>

<p>With Internet Service Manager (HTML), you can operate Microsoft SMTP Service remotely using Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). To use this tool, you must use Microsoft Internet Explorer version 3.0 or later, or another Web browser. The configuration options are the same in Internet Service Manager (HTML) as in Internet Service Manager, with the following exceptions:</p>
<UL>
	<LI>Configuring relay restrictions for managing UCE
	<LI>Enabling transaction logging 
	<LI>Granting or denying access for specific computers
	<LI>Using Key Manager to install certificates
	<LI>Granting operator permissions to individual Windows NT Server accounts 
</UL>
<p>
<STRONG>Starting Internet Service Manager (HTML)</STRONG></P>
<p>
<UL>
	<LI>From the <STRONG>Start</STRONG> menu, choose <STRONG>Programs</STRONG>, select <STRONG>Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack</STRONG>, select <STRONG>Microsoft Internet Information Server</STRONG>, select <STRONG>Microsoft SMTP Service</STRONG>, and then select <STRONG>SMTP Service Manager (HTML)</STRONG>. 
</UL>
<p>
<STRONG>Note</STRONG> If you change the default document settings in the <STRONG>Documents</STRONG> property sheet for the default Web site in Internet Service Manager, you must also change them in the Mail node. For example, if you disable the default document or rename Default.htm, you cannot start Internet Service Manager (HTML) by choosing <STRONG>SMTP Service Manager (HTML)</STRONG> from the <STRONG>Start</STRONG> menu. To prevent this from occurring, configure the Mail node as follows:

<OL>
	<LI>In Internet Service Manager, expand the directory hierarchy for the default Web site.
	<LI>Select the <STRONG>Mail</STRONG> node.
	<LI>From the <STRONG>Action</STRONG> menu, choose <STRONG>Properties</STRONG>.
	<LI>In the <STRONG>Documents</STRONG> property sheet, select <STRONG>Enable Default Document</STRONG> and make sure that Default.htm is included in the list box.
</OL>
<p>If you change the document settings again later for the default Web site, choose not to override the Mail settings in the <STRONG>Inheritance Overrides</STRONG> dialog box.</p>


<hr>

<h2><a name="Known">Known Issues</a></h2>

<p>The following list contains known issues for Microsoft SMTP Service.</p>

<p><STRONG>Using WINS or a HOSTS file for Intranet service</STRONG></p>

<p>Although DNS is required to deploy Microsoft SMTP Service on the Internet, WINS or a HOSTS file can be substituted for DNS when using Microsoft SMTP Service on an intranet.</p>

<p><STRONG>Messages can be corrupted under low disk conditions</STRONG></p>

<p>Messages can be corrupted when available disk space is low or exhausted on the Mailroot directory. Place the Mailroot directory on drives that have adequate disk space.</p>

<p><STRONG>Cannot selectively bind multiple IP addresses to a single SMTP site</STRONG></p>

<p>Does not support selective binding of multiple IP addresses to a single SMTP site. The choices are either a single IP address or all unassigned IP addresses.</p>

<p><STRONG>Missing event logs when Microsoft SMTP Service is running</STRONG></p>

<p>Some configuration changes are not logged to the event log when the service is running (for example, default domain changes, smart host changes, and site starting and stopping). No configuration changes are logged to the event log when the service is not running.</p>

<p><STRONG>Changing Microsoft SMTP Service Badmail directory</STRONG></p>

<p>The administration interface does not validate that the Badmail directory is on a local drive. You must always specify a local drive for the Badmail directory.</p>

<p><STRONG>Master properties are not supported for Microsoft SMTP Service</STRONG></p>

<p>In the <STRONG>Internet Information Server</STRONG> property sheet for the computer in Internet Service Manager, Microsoft SMTP Service is not listed under <STRONG>Master Properties</STRONG>. Microsoft SMTP Service does not support setting master properties. Multiple SMTP sites cannot be created.</p>

<p><STRONG>Imprecise NDR on some looping cases</STRONG></p>

<p>In cases when the SMTP server tries to connect to itself, the non-delivery report (NDR) displays the message &quot;Connection to host &lt;hostname&gt; failed.&quot; The correct message is &quot;Cannot connect to self.&quot;</p>

<p><STRONG>Microsoft SMTP Service adds extra blank lines to messages placed in the Drop directory</STRONG></p>

<p>Microsoft SMTP Service adds an extra blank line to the end of messages placed in the Drop directory.</p>
