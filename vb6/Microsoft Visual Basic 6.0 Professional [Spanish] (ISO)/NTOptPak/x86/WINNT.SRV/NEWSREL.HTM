Additional documentation for Microsoft NNTP Service can be reached by selecting <strong>Product Documentation</strong> in the Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) program group.</p>

<h2><a name="HardwareSoftware">Hardware and Software Requirements</a></h2>

<p>This version of Microsoft Microsoft NNTP Service has the same minimum hardware requirements as Windows NT Server version 4.0 and Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) version 4.0. It is important that you plan thoroughly before building your news service.To install and run Microsoft NNTP Service, the following software must be installed:</p>

<ul>
<li>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0</li>
<li>Microsoft Windows NT Service Pack 3 (or later), available in the \Support\qfe directory on the installation compact disc or from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/ntserversupport/" target="_top">http://www.microsoft.com/ntserversupport/</a></li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="installation">Installation</a></h2>

<p>Microsoft Microsoft NNTP Service is installed as part of Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) 4.0.  After Windows NT Service Pack 3 is set up, follow the installation instructions included with IIS 4.0. As part of the installation, select the &quot;Microsoft NNTP Service&quot; check box.</p>

<h2><a name="client">Client Software</a></h2>

<p>You can use any NNTP-compatible client, such as the Microsoft Internet Mail and News component of Microsoft Internet Explorer version 3.02 or 4.0. To enable security, you must use a client that supports secure sockets layer (SSL) or Windows NT Challenge/Response, such as Internet Mail and News.</p>

<p>You can download Microsoft Internet Explorer from 
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/ie">http://www.microsoft.com/ie</a>. 
Be sure to download the Typical version of Internet Explorer, which includes Internet Mail and News. If you already have Internet Explorer but you are missing the Internet Mail and News reader, you can download it separately by following the features and components link.</p>

<h2><a name="KnownIssues">Known Issues</a></h2>

<h3>RPC Locator Service Must be Started</h3>

<p>The Remote Procedure Call (RPC) Locator service must be started if you are using the Internet Service Manager administration program.</p>

<p><strong>To start the RPC Locator service:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>From the <strong>Start</strong> menu, choose <strong>Settings</strong> and <strong>Control Panel</strong>.<br></li>
<li>Select the <strong>Services</strong> application.<br></li>
<li>In the <strong>Service</strong> box, select <strong> Remote Procedure Call (RPC) Locator</strong>, and then choose <strong>Start</strong>.
</ol>

<h3>Unattended Option Pack Installation For Installing Microsoft NNTP Service </h3>

<p>If you are using Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) on an intranet, you can copy the Unattend.txt file from the Windows NT Option Pack compact disc to a folder on the local computer and perform unattended installations from that folder. This is useful because Microsoft NNTP Service is not a default component during Setup. The Unattend.txt file is located on the compact disc in the \CPU type\inetsrv\directory, where CPU type is the processor on the computer where IIS will be installed.</p>
<p>
<strong>To start unattended setup</strong><br>

<ol>
<li>Copy Unattend.txt to your local drive and make any necessary changes to install the appropriate components. </li> 
<li>Edit the [Components] section to include <i>iis_nntp = on</i> and <i>iis_nntp_docs = on</i>.
<li>At a command prompt, change to the directory on the compact disc that contains Setup.exe and enter the following command:
<code><strong>setup/u:</strong><em>drive</em><strong>:</strong><em>path</em><strong>\Unattend.txt</strong></code>
<br>
where <em>drive</em> is the drive and <em>path</em> is the full path on the local computer where Unattend.txt is located.
For example:<br>
<code>setup/u:c:\temp\unattend.txt </code></li>
</ol>

<h3>Using Moderated Newsgroups and SMTP</h3>

<p>Postings to moderated newsgroups are sent to the moderator using SMTP with an empty Mail From: envelope line. For these messages to be received, the SMTP server must have an account set up to accommodate the requests.</p><br>

<h3>NNTP Service Manager (HTML)</h3>
<p>If NNTP Service Manager (HTML) does not start, type the following
URL in your Web browser:<br>
<a href="http://localhost/news/admin/default.htm">
http://localhost/news/admin/default.htm</a></p><br>

<h3>Virtual Directories Terminology</h3>

<p>Windows NT Server event logs use the term &quot;virtual roots&quot; to refer to virtual directories.</p><br>

<h3>Using WINS and Host Tables for Intranet Service</h3>

<p>Although Domain Name System (DNS) is required to deploy Microsoft NNTP Service on the Internet, WINS or host tables can be substituted for DNS when using Microsoft NNTP Service on an intranet.</p><br>

<h3>Naming Newsgroups</h3>

<p>It is recommended that you use 7-bit (lower ASCII) characters for newsgroup names.</p><br>

<h3>Registry Keys</h3>

<p>The following preferences cannot be changed in the administration user interface. They can, however, be modified through the Windows NT Server registry.  The Microsoft NNTP Service settings are located under the following registry key:</p>

<p><strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\NNTPSvc\Parameters</strong></p>

<h3>Web Administration Authentication</h3>

If you use a browser that does not support Windows NT Challenge/Response, IIS server settings for the Web administration directory must be changed.</p>
