<a name="E10E11"><strong>Welcome</strong></a>

<p><strong>Important</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This README file provides useful information that may not be included in the online documentation. 
</p>

<a name="E10E12"><strong>System Requirements</strong></a>

<p>Content Analyzer requires the following minimum software and hardware environment for optimal performance:</p>

<p><strong>Hardware Requirements:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Pentium processor</li>
<li>32 MB of memory is recommended (16 MB minimum)</li>
<li>15 MB disk space for the program, documentation, and sample maps</li>
<li>Internet connection (direct or modem)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Software Requirements:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Microsoft&reg; Windows NT&reg; version 4.0</li>
<li>An Internet browser</li>
<li>Plug-in applications for multimedia (recommended)</li>
<li>Publishing and authoring tools for editing resource files (recommended)</li>
</ul>

<a name="E10E13"><p><strong>Browser Compatibility</strong></p></a>

<p>We've tested Content Analyzer with the most popular 
browsers. The following browsers have been verified to 
work with Content Analyzer:</p>

<ul>
<li>Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.02 (or later)</li>
<li>Netscape Navigator 3.0 (or later)</li>
</ul> 

<p>If you're running previous versions of these products, 
we recommend that you upgrade to the newer versions. 
</p>

<a name="E10E15"><p><strong>Configuring Content Analyzer to Work With Your Proxy Server</strong></p></a>

<p>To configure Content Analyzer to be used in conjunction with an established  proxy server, enter the
appropriate information in the <strong>Proxy</strong> tab of the Content Analyzer <strong>View/Program
Options</strong> dialog box. If you're not sure if you are using a proxy server, contact your system
administrator. You may also need to ask your administrator for any required user name or password.</p>

<a name="E10E18"><p><strong>Known Issues</strong></p></a>

<p>Please note the following known issues:</p>

<p>When mapping a site, Content Analyzer will access every URL within that site.  This is equivalent to a user clicking on every link.  If you have links to gateway scripts that have side effects (for example, manipulating records in a database), these will all be executed, potentially altering data stored outside of the HTML content of the site.
</p>
