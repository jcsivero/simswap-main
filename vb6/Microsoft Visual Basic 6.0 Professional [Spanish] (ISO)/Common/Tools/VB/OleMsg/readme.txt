OLEMSG.HLP is a Windows Help file that documents the entire OLE
Messaging library. It includes complete reference information, a
programmer's guide, and many brief code examples.

OLEMSG.XLS is a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet containing all the 
sample source code that appears in the OLE Messaging 
documentation. There are no complete sample programs, but many 
short routines illustrating how to use various OLE messaging features.

sample application, written for Visual Basic. There is a server 
program which maintains a list of users and summarizes their 
timecard reports, and a client program that is used to fill out a 
timecard. Refer to README.TXT in the TIMECARD.CLI directory 
for more details.
