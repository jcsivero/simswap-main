This directory contains process viewers that allow you to view and terminate
processes on your system.  PVIEW.EXE runs under Windows NT and PView95 runs
under Windows 95.  Under Windows NT 4.0 the task manager has most of the same
capabilities as PVIEW.EXE.

Installation

Copy the appropriate version of PView to your hard drive or run it from the
CD.
