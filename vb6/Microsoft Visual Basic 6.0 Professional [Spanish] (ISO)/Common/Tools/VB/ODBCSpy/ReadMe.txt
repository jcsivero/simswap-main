ODBC Spy
--------

ODBC Spy is a utility that allows you to log the ODBC API calls produced by 
your VB application.  It is useful for tracking down problems in VB applications
that use ODBC drivers to access data.  The Log produced by ODBC Spy is usually
easier to read than the log produced by the ODBC driver manager.  An additional
benefit is that ODBC Spy can log to the screen as well as to a file.  Additional
documentation for ODBC Spy is included in ODBCSPY.HLP.
