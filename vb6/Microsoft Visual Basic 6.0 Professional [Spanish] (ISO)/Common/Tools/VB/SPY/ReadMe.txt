\Tools\Spy

Spy++ (SPYXX.EXE) is a Win32-based utility that gives you a graphical 
view of the system's processes, threads, windows, and window messages. 
With Spy++, you can: 

- Display a graphical tree of relationships among system objects,
  including processes, threads, and windows.
- Search for specified windows, threads, processes, or messages.
- View the properties of selected windows, threads, processes, or 
  messages.
- Select a window, thread, process, or message directly from the view.
- Use the Finder Tool to select a window by mouse positioning.
- Set message options using complex message log selection parameters.

Please refer to spyxx.help for more information!

NOTE: SPYXX.EXE requires MFC 4.2, which can be found in the 
\Tools\MFC42 directory. Copy the files from \Tools\MFC42 to your 
\Windows\System directory, and then run SPYXX.EXE.
