<H2>Goodbye World</H2>
<!-- Updated to use Version 1.5.1 -->

<HR width=66%>
<P>This variation on the Hello World example demonstrates scripting
<BR>a Microsoft Agent character to respond to voice commands.

<P>Be patient! Loading of Genie may take a few minutes.
<BR>Once Genie appears, right-click on him to see what commands he is
<BR>listening for.  While holding down the <B>Scroll Lock</B> key, try saying
<BR>one of these commands.  If Genie doesn't respond, here are some
<BR><B><A href="#trouble">troubleshooting hints</A></B>.

<P>This sample loads its character from an HTTP URL, so you must be
<BR>connected to the WWW and be able to reach the server at
<BR><I>http://agent.microsoft.com</I>, or the sample will not work properly.

<P>If you have never installed the Lernout & Hauspie TTS Engine,
<BR>you will be prompted to install it.  Without the TTS Engine,
<BR>characters will not produce speech output.

<P>If you have never installed the Microsoft Command and Control
<BR>Engine, you will be prompted to do so.  Characters will not
<BR>be able to recognize spoken commands without the C & C Engine.

<P>Right-click on the page and select <B>View Source</B>
<BR>to examine the HTML code for this page.

In order to use Microsoft Agent, the Microsoft Agent Control
OBJECT tag must be placed on the page.  The presence of this

attribute is used so that the latest version number can be
specified.  The URL given is the location of the Agent control
in the Microsoft ActiveX object store.
The Agent object will be referred to in script using the name
assigned to it in the ID field of the OBJECT tag - in this case,
"AgentControl".
